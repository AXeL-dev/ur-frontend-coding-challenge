# Front-end Coding Challenge

This repository is my own implementation of the [United Remote front-end coding challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/frontend-coding-challenge).

## Implemented features

* [x] As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
* [x] As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
* [x] As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
 - Repository name.
 - Repository description.
 - Number of stars for the repo.
 - Number of issues for the repo.
 - Username and avatar of the owner.
* [x] As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).

## Used technologies

Since i'm not familar with the most of "**well-known**" front-end technologies out there, in addition of being more oriented on back-end coding & problems solving than being focused on some front-end code, i used [AngularsJS](https://angularjs.org/) which is much easier to learn & use (for me) than Angular 2, React or Vue. The second choice i could use was [Riot.js](https://riot.js.org/) which is more similar to React but it's less known & of course less popular.

Other tools:
- **npm** as my dependencies manager.
- **git** for version control.
- **moment.js** for date manipulation.
- **Bootstrap 4** for styling.
- **Jquery** for easier ajax requests & mostly because it's required by bootstrap.
- **ng-infinite-scroll** to load more results on page scroll.

## FAQ

- You said that you prefer back-end programming, so why didn't you go for the [back-end coding challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/coding-challenge.md) then?

> Sincerely, the weekend is my only free time right now & the front-end challenge seems to be more easier to achieve & can be simply hosted on github pages.

- Why don't you use any of the popular front-end technologies like Angular 2, React or Vue?

> I don't think that the used technology matters more than code quality, structure or optimisation. However, i have already some basic knowledge about the 3 mentioned frameworks & i'm open to start using any of them if needed.
