# Front-end Coding Challenge

This repository is my own implementation of the [United Remote front-end coding challenge](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/frontend-coding-challenge).

[View Demo](https://axel-dev.github.io/ur-frontend-coding-challenge/)

## Implemented features

* [x] As a User I should be able to list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
* [x] As a User I should see the results as a list. One repository per row.
* [x] As a User I should be able to see for each repo/row the following details :
 - Repository name.
 - Repository description.
 - Number of stars for the repo.
 - Number of issues for the repo.
 - Username and avatar of the owner.
* [x] As a User I should be able to keep scrolling and new results should appear (pagination).

## Used technologies

- **Angularjs** as the main javascript library.
- **npm** as my dependencies manager.
- **git** for version control.
- **moment.js** for date manipulation.
- **Bootstrap 4** for styling.
- **ng-infinite-scroll** to load more results on page scroll.
